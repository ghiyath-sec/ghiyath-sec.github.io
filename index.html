How does it work under the hood?

The app opens your webcam and processes every single video frame in real time:

Face & eye landmarks with MediaPipe:
Using Google’s MediaPipe, the program extracts a detailed face mesh (468 points) and focuses on the landmarks around your eyes. From these points, it can figure out your gaze direction and whether your eyes are open or closed.

Calibration phase:
At the start, it records around 30 frames while you sit still, calculates the neutral eye position, and uses that as a baseline. After that, any small eye movement becomes significant.

Mapping eyes to the screen:
By calculating the center of both eyes, the program converts that position from camera coordinates (e.g., 640×480) to your actual screen size. If your eyes are in the middle of the camera feed, the cursor moves to the center of your screen.

Smooth movement:
To avoid jumpy movements, a smooth factor is applied so the cursor glides naturally instead of making abrupt jumps.

Clicking with your eyes:
This is where EAR (Eye Aspect Ratio) comes in. When EAR drops below a certain threshold for a short period → a click is triggered. If you close your eyes a bit longer, it performs a click-and-hold until you open your eyes again.

All of this runs in real time, which means the system needs to keep the balance between speed and accuracy while processing every frame.

Main technologies used:
OpenCV: Capturing and processing video frames.
MediaPipe: Extracting precise face and eye landmarks.
PyAutoGUI: Moving the mouse and performing clicks.
NumPy: Fast mathematical operations and smoothing calculations.
Tkinter: A simple GUI to adjust sensitivity and cursor speed.

The final experience?
You look around – the mouse moves. You blink intentionally – a click happens. Hold your eyes closed a bit longer – a click-and-hold is triggered. And it all works with a regular webcam.

Why this project matters to me:
This type of system could help people who can’t use a mouse or keyboard normally. It also opens doors for contactless computer interaction, which is becoming increasingly important.

What’s next?
The next step is to integrate voice commands. Imagine opening applications, performing actions with your voice while controlling the cursor with your eyes.
The vision: a fully touchless computer experience."></span>

This project demonstrates my expertise in enterprise-level network security architecture.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>Business Challenge:</strong></p>
                            <p>The company required a secure network architecture that could handle two distinct types of services:</p>
                            <p>• Public-facing services (websites and user applications)</p>
                            <p>• Private internal systems (development environments, databases, admin dashboards)</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>Technical Solution:</strong></p>
                            <p><strong>Public Services (DMZ Architecture):</strong></p>
                            <p>Implemented a secure DMZ where all public domains (app.example.com, blog.example.com, login.example.com) route through pfSense WAN interface. HAProxy performs SNI-based routing to distribute traffic to appropriate servers within the DMZ. This eliminates direct access to public servers - all traffic is controlled through pfSense firewall and reverse proxy.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>Private Network (LAN):</strong></p>
                            <p>Established a completely isolated internal network with no direct external access. Implemented role-based access control where developers and administrators connect via OpenVPN, then access resources based on their specific permissions defined in firewall rules. Developers have access only to development environments, while administrators maintain full system access.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>Network Segmentation:</strong></p>
                            <p>Created strict isolation between DMZ and LAN networks. When DMZ services require database access, specific firewall rules are implemented to allow only necessary traffic. All other cross-zone communication is blocked by default.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>Security Benefits:</strong></p>
                            <p>• Public services remain accessible while being protected through controlled access points</p>
                            <p>• Internal network is completely isolated from external threats</p>
                            <p>• Centralized monitoring and access control from a single management point</p>
                            <p>• Role-based access ensures users can only access authorized resources</p>
